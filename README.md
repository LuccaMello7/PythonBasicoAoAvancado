ðŸ“ƒ This noteboos were written while I was taking the following course [Python 3 Course From Zero to Hero - Luiz OtÃ¡vio Miranda](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-do-zero-ao-avancado/)

This course is probably one of the best resources for those who wants to learn Python and how to start to coding well.

During this course is possible to see that Luiz is a very knowlegbe guy. Also he teaches in a very unique way that is possible to coding and have some fun while doing the course.
